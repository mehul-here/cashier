#  Ok so finally learning github 
<br>
This is actually a project i made for my college take home quiz and i looking forward to put more hard questions given by my professor in github 
<br>
So this project is a cashier which will help to calculate how much change is required 
<br>
I tried to take all the cases in here like putting wrong input such as string instead of digits and also putting value of order more than the given amount. 
<br> 
I hope whoever is reading this liked my project.
<br>
I know it is not as efficient as it can be 
<br>
Btw i forgot to mention but you can notice that this does not req recursion but i still used it . This is because the professor asked us to use recursion to make this cashier or else zero marks were going to be awarded to us. 
<br> 
If you have any suggestion make sure to shot at me . 
<br> 
Thank u for taking look at my project
